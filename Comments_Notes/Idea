For each question in questions.json return:
title as <p>
options as <input radio button>

Check each answer for question against rides.json
Closest ride match = result

For each possible result a {{result}}.png (I'll make that in PS and store as an asset in assets)

Twitter/Facebook share button at results page to share result with result image for assets
